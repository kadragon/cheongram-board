# Tasks Ledger

This directory tracks execution history for the SDD × TDD loop.

- `backlog.md` records open questions and clarifications (must reference SPEC-ID / TEST-ID once available).
- `log-YYYY-MM-DD.md` captures daily RED → GREEN → REFACTOR notes, rollback records, and trace metadata.
- Additional task files (e.g., sprint plans, DoD checklists) belong here as needed.

> Traceability Reminder: Every entry must include relevant `Trace: SPEC-…, TEST-…` tags when specs/tests exist.
